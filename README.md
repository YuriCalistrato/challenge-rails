  *  Devise for security. Devise has tons of security strategies that could be used and handled for security measures.
* Permission Layer -> [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan)
  *  Using with Credential System(Auth System), we can set scope permissions.
* WebUi -> SPA -> [VueJS](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) / [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular)
  *  Opted to use SPA due to timeload and optimizations.
